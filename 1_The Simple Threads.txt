#The Simple Threads#

Threads are sometimes called lightweight processes. Both processes and threads provide an execution environment, but creating a
new thread requires fewer resources than creating a new process.

Threads exist within a process — every process has at least one. Threads share the process's resources, including memory and
open files. This makes for efficient, but potentially problematic, communication.

Multithreaded execution is an essential feature of the Java platform. Every application has at least one thread — or several, if
you count "system" threads that do things like memory management and signal handling. But from the application programmer's
point of view, you start with just one thread, called the main thread. This thread has the ability to create additional threads,
as we'll demonstrate in the next section.
